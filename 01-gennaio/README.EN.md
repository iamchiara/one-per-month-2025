## The project
The creative idea of January is a dice game, in both material and digital versions. It is a very simple game whose rules can be summarized as "Win if there is no one". You roll dice (at least 3) and you receive a point if the number chosen is not there. If the chosen number appears on at least n/2 dice (n = number of dice) one point is lost. The game also contemplates the possibility of an "undecided" die, which therefore did not stop on a clear number due to the irregularity of the surface. In this case, the dice (or dice) in question is rolled again.

## Rules of the game
### Traditional rules
- 🔢 While the dice are mixed each player chooses a number from 1 to 6.
- 🎲 You roll the dice. 
- 👍 If the chosen number is not there you win a point.
- 👎 If it is present in number greater than or equal to half of the dice you lose a point. Otherwise you proceed to play.
- ❓ If the die is undecided it draws again.
- 🏆 First to 5 points wins the match

### Digital rules
- ⚙ After setting the game parameters, the game takes place exactly as it would take place in reality.
- ❓ If in the initial settings it has been decided that the die can be undecided, it will also be pulled again digitally.

## Game parameters (digital version)
The game parameters to set are:
- Number of players

    >Check that it is not less than 1. 
- Number of dice

    >Check that it is not less than 3.
- Dice undecided

    >If the answer is 0 they will not be present, otherwise they are active by default.
- Waiting for authorization to roll dice

    >Serves to slow down the game in case all players are controlled by the computer. If the answer is 0 it will not be required, otherwise it is active by default.
- Details players

## Challenges
Setting the initial parameters correctly and making sure that no input was wrong took some time, but it was fun and challenging.
